# SwiftLife
Conway's Game of Life, in the Swift language (for iOS)

This implementation borrows heavily from a tutorial created by Colin Eberhardt in August 2014.
In that post, Colin shows how to create GOL using functional idioms in the Swift language.

I have implemented a functional version, without optimization.  Colin shows some clever caching/memoization
to improve performance. As I am more interested in the basic functional algorithms, I did not implement that functionality.

As Don Knuth says... "premature optimization is the root of all evil."
